monitoring function correlates voice and data intercepts across diverse 
networks to provide a comprehensive intelligence picture. ComTrail 
supports the capture, record and replay of a variety of Voice and IP 
communications in pretty much any type of communication, including - but not limited to- Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, BlackBerry, ICQ and GSM voice calls. ComTrail intercepts data from any type of network 
-whether Wireless, packet data, Wire line or VoIP networks- and can 
decode hundreds of protocols and P2P applications, including HTTP, 
Instant Messengers, Web-mails, VoIP Calls and MMS. Doubles up as Targeted Monitoring System. (2) xTrail: Targeted IP Monitoring: xTrail
 is a solution for interception, decoding and analysis of high speed 
data traffic over IP networks and independently monitors ISPs/GPRS and 
3G networks. xTrail has been designed in such a way that it can be 
deployed within minutes and enables law enforcement agencies to 
intercept and monitor targeted communications without degrading the 
service quality of the IP network. This product is capable of 
intercepting all types of networks -including wireline, wireless, cable,
 VoIP and VSAT networks- and acts as a black box for “record and replay”
 targeted Internet communications.
Interestingly enough, xTrail can filter based on a 
“pure keyword”, a URL/Domain with a keyword, an IP address, a mobile 
number or even with just a user identity, such as an email ID, chat ID 
or VoIP ID. Furthermore, xTrail can be integrated with link analysis 
tools and can export data in a digital format which can allegedly be 
presented in court as evidence.Stand-alone solution for interception, decoding and analysis of multi Gigabit IP traffic. Easily integrates with any existing centralized monitoring system for extended coverage. (3) QuickTrail: Tactical Wi-Fi Monitoring: QuickTrail
 is a device which is designed to gather intelligence from public 
Internet networks, when a target is operating from a cyber cafe, a 
hotel, a university campus or a free Wi-Fi zone. In particular, 
QuickTrail is equipped with multiple monitoring tools and techniques 
that can help intercept almost any wired, Wi-Fi or hybrid Internet 
network so that a target communication can be monitored. QuickTrail can 
be deployed within fractions of seconds to intercept, reconstruct, 
replay and analyze email, chat, VoIP and other Internet activities of a 
target. This device supports real time monitoring and wiretapping of 
Ethernet LANs.
According to ClearTrail’s brochure, QuickTrail is a 
“all-in-one” device which can intercept secured communications, know 
passwords with c-Jack attack, alert on activities of a target, support 
active and passive interception of Wi-Fi and wired LAN and capture, 
reconstruct and replay. It is noteworthy that QuickTrail can identify a 
target machine on the basis of an IP address, MAC ID, machine name, 
activity status and several other parameters. In addition, QuickTrail 
supports protocol decoding, including HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and HTTPS. This 
device also enables the remote and central management of field 
operations at geographically different locations. Hightlights: QuickTrail (1) Intercepts Wi-Fi and wired LANs in five different ways, (2) Breaks WEP, WPA/WPA2 to rip-off secured Wi-Fi networks, (3) Deploys spyware into a target’s machine, (4) Monitor’s Gmail, Yahoo and all other HTTPS-based communications, (5) Reconstructs webmails, chats, VoIP calls, news groups and social networks. (4) Astra: Remote Monitoring and Infection framework: Astra can push bot to any targeted machine sharing the same
 LAN (wired, wi-fi or hybrid). The SEED is a generic bot which can 
identify a target’s location, log keystrokes, capture screen-shots, 
capture Mic, listen to Skype calls, capture webcams and search the 
target’s browsing history. Additionally, the SEED bot can also be 
remotely activated, deactivated or terminated, as and when required. 
Astra allegedly provides an un-traceable reporting mechanism that 
operates without using any proxies, which overrules the possibility of 
getting traced by the target. Highlights: Astra (1) Proactive intelligence gathering, (2) End-to-end remote infection and monitoring framework, (3) Follow the target, beat encryption, listen to in-room conversations, capture keystrokes and screen shots, (4) Designed for centralized management of thousands of targets, (5) A wide range of deployment mechanisms to optimize success ration, (6) Non-traceable, non-detectable delivery mechanism, (7) Intrusive yet stealthy, (8) Easy interface for handling most complex tasks, (9) Successfully tested over the current top 10 anti-virus available in the market, (10) No third party dependencies, (11) Free from any back-door intervention (http://www.wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/CLEARTRAIL-2011-Intemonisuit-en.pdf)  ","ComTrail: Instant Analysis across thousands of Terabyte, Equipped to handle millions of communications per day intercepted over high speed STM & Ethernet Links & Correlates Identities across multiple networks (http://www.wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/CLEARTRAIL-2011-Intemonisuit-en.pdf)","(1) ComTrail: Mass Monitoring of IP and Voice Networks: ComTrail is deployed within a service provider network and its

Instant Messengers, Web-mails, VoIP Calls and MMS. Doubles up as Targeted Monitoring System. (2) mTrail: Off-The-Air Interception: mTrail
 offers active and passive ‘off-the-air’ interception of GSM 
900/1800/1900 Mhz phone calls and data to meet law enforcement 
surveillance and investigation requirements. The mTrail passive 
interception system works in the stealth mode so that there is no 
dependence on the network operator and so that the target is unaware of 
the interception of its communications.
The mTrail system has the capability to scale from 
interception of 2 channels (carrier frequencies) to 32 channels. mTrail 
can be deployed either in a mobile or fixed mode: in the mobile mode the
 system is able to fit into a briefcase, while in the fixed mode the 
system fits in a rack-mount industrial grade chassis.
Target location identification is supported by using 
signal strength, target numbers, such as IMSI, TIMSI, IMEI or MSI SDN, 
which makes it possible to listen to the conversation on so-called 
“lawfully intercepted” calls in near real-time, as well as to store all 
calls. Additionally, mTrail supports the interception of targeted calls 
from pre-defined suspect lists and the monitoring of SMS and protocol 
information. Highlights: mTrail (1) Designed for passive interception of GSM communications, (2) Intercepts Voice and SMS “off-the-air”, (3)  Detects the location of the target, (4) Can be deployed as a fixed unit or mounted in a surveillance van, (5) No support required from GSM operator (http://www.wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/CLEARTRAIL-2011-Intemonisuit-en.pdf)",ComTrail: Speaker Recognition (http://www.wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/CLEARTRAIL-2011-Intemonisuit-en.pdf),,ComTrail: Target Location (http://www.wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/CLEARTRAIL-2011-Intemonisuit-en.pdf),"ComTrail: Instant Analysis across thousands of Terabytes. xTrail can be integrated with link analysis tools and can export data in

 Inspection (DPI) technology to perform in-depth packet search across 
all seven network layers. VEHO DPI engine uses layer-7 pattern matching 
and behavior analysis technology for detection & filtration. 
Usually, this packet search involves superior algorithms to conduct 
complex, parametric searches meeting exact user requirements. In case of session-wise monitoring, if a single packet contains its 
payload data in Gzip or any other compressed format, VEHO DPI decodes 
the payload data before performing a search. VEHO DPI intercepts packets
 at multiples of  10 Gbps data transfer rate in a small form factor 
servers. A wide variety of interception criteria are supported for the 
interception of IPDR & CmC data, such as multiple-keyword, 
special-character, wild card, case-sensitivity, keyword within 
attachments, keywords within mails to name a few. VEHO DPI Probe has the
 capability of configuring thousands of complex keywords without 
degradation in performance (http://www.veheretech.com/products/veho-dpi/). VEHO Replay: a subsystem of CommuLIM Monitoring Centre. VEHO Replay is an advanced IP

 data in the same format as seen by your target/suspect. With web 2.0 
and Ajax technologies messing the reconstruction, VEHO RE is advanced 
enough to correlate data so that “You see what they See”. The RE’s role 
is to receive the captured packets and convert them into a readable data
 format, which can be comprehended and processed further by the advanced
 Analytics Engine. VEHO Replay supports a wide range of protocols including IP, TCP, UDP, 
RTMP, HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, FTP, FTP-Control, FTP-Data, Jabber, YMSG,

Lawful Intercept solution: ""We have been instrumental in the 
deployment of world’s first - converged monitoring platform for TDM and 
IP networks to monitor PSTN, GSM, CDMA, WiMax, WiFi, xDSL, etc. Our 
solution is highly scalable as we add multiple front-ends (mediation) on
 the network keeping a single management platform; this leads to faster 
integration capabilities and cost saving. This forms an ideal solution 
for centralized monitoring across all forms of public communication 
networks. We can provide solutions for: only TDM, only IP and converged 
TDM and IP monitoring as per network’s requirements.Our 
solution captures and renders all kind of traffic – providing key 
intelligence from TDM networks – voice, SMS and also of web browsing, 
email, chat, etc. to LEAs in real time. We can also render 3G video call
 in near real time and simultaneously forward the 3G video call of a 
target to a LEA agent’s handset"" (http://spantel.in/content.php?type=Solution&solID=2) 2. URL Filtering:Web Filtering solution provides support for category based URL filtering for more than 20 million URLs and billions of web pages (http://spantel.in/content.php?type=Solution&solID=4) 3. IP Traffic Analysis: Span’s IP traffic analysis solution gives 
detailed information on network bandwidth usage pattern for traffic 
analysis, application analysis, capacity planning, product planning and 
making policy decisions. By drilling down into the specific 
applications, users, ports or communication, network managers are able 
to determine the exact source of spikes and bursts and therefore are 
able to proactively monitor, control and take informed decisions. Key Features: Total network view across the world's 
largest IP networks that includes both deep traffic inspection and full 
correlation of Layer 2 and Layer7 information across all links and 
elements   Industry-leading packet processing 
performance that supports network speeds up to OC-192/10G off the wire 
and uses a distributed architecture to scale so it can process 
multi-petabytes of data   Carrier-class scalability and 
reliability with over 2.7 petabytes of IP traffic processed at a single 
customer, driving 100 billion packet records per day (greater than 7 
terabytes) to upstream security applications   Full traffic correlation across every link and element on the network   Entropy-based security algorithms, 
provide unprecedented early detection of sophisticated anomalies such as
 low volume and polymorphic worms   Next generation traffic analysis with 
advanced algorithms for real-time security, intercept and traffic 
classification and mitigation   Total network view across the world's 
largest IP networks that includes both deep traffic inspection and full 
correlation of Layer 2 and Layer 7 information across all links and 
elements , (http://spantel.in/content.php?type=Solution&solID=6), 4. Taps and msart filters: Network tap is a passive device that sits between two network devices (router, switch, firewall) and redirects 100% traffic to security and network management tools 
without interrupting the actual traffic. The complete range of 
network taps includes some smart devices, which do a lot more than just 
redirecting the traffic to monitoring tools.Regeneration Taps allow 
you to simultaneously examine all of the traffic on your links with a 
variety of security and network monitoring tools. All data from one or 
two network links is duplicated to a maximum of eight ports for 
increased monitoring device flexibility.Aggregation Taps combine 
traffic from multiple network links, delivering all data into either one
 or up to four monitor ports. This benefit allows for leveraging 
valuable monitoring devices throughout an organization.Bypass Switches provide a 
fail-safe access port for in-line network security monitoring devices. 
Link downtime prevention technology limits outages by switching traffic 
around an IPS in the event of power outages, scheduled maintenance or 
application failure. Director is a high-density data-monitoring 
switch in a 1 U chassis featuring TapFlow, a wire-speed filtering engine
 that directs traffic by protocol, IP address, and other packet header 
information to specific monitoring tools (http://spantel.in/content.php?type=Solution&solID=7)
