							<h6>Bhaktapur</h6>
							<p>On the ancient trade route between Tibet and India stands the charming Newar town of Bhaktapur, famously known for it's rich culture and traditional craft works. We work with a group of fair trade weavers here that operate traditional wooden handlooms that have remained unchanged for the last several hundred years. It's apparent here that excellent quality combined with solid traditional techniques never go out of style! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>

							<h5>Kathmandu</h5>
							<p>Colored by it's rich cultural heritage but mired by it's pervasive poverty, Kathmandu is a dynamic city of sublime and squalor. Here, we work with several fair trade and nonprofit organizations to empower craft communities through training, development and access to global markets. From employment of victims of sex trafficking to sustaining family run silversmith workshops, our aim is to help facilitate sustainable development through fair trade partnerships. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>

						<li data-wikidata="Q1216891" geo-label-placement="NE" geo-lat="32.23" geo-lon="76.32">
							<h6>Dharamsala</h6>
							<p>On the foothills of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhauladhar">Indian Himalayas</a> is the quaint town of Dharamsala where Old Yak Bazaar was born. Home to the Dalai Lama and the heart of the Tibetan exile community, we partner with several Tibetan organizations that work to improve the livelihoods of Tibetan exiles through training and employment. Dharamsala is Old Yak's second home so we promise to bring you the very best from this awesome hill town!  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>
						</li>
						<li data-wikidata="Q1216891" geo-label-placement="SW" geo-lat="32.09" geo-lon="76.26">
							<h6>Kangra</h6>
							<p>Situated on the western Himalayas in the state of Himachal Pradesh, we partner with the <a href="http://kangraarts.org/">Kangra Arts Promotion Society</a> in an effort to preserve, sustain and promote the dying tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra_painting">Kangra miniature paintings</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>

							<h5>New Delhi</h5>
							<p>In the bustling capital city of India, we work with several innovative social enterprises that combine social impact and environmental change to bring you some truly awesome products. From fair trade groups working to empower disadvantaged slum communities to entrepreneurs upcycling elephant poo, we deliver to you the coolest stuff from the urban jungle of New Delhi.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>

							<h6>Bahadurgarh</h6>
							<p>One man's trash is another man's treasure. But unfortunately, this isn't evident to most people who see the sprawling garbage heaps across India. We work with an ingenious fair trade organization here that upcycle India's trash heaps into high fashion. From disposed plastic bags, tire tubes to used fire hoses, we bring you the epitome of recyclage chic. So our upcycling motto is, why let it decompose for a thousand years when it can be lovingly owned by you, me or the Joe next door! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>

							<h5>Jaipur</h5>
							<p>Affectionately known as the "Pink City", Jaipur stands proud as the capital of the state Rajasthan. In this handicraft hub of India, we work with the textile that's most commonly associated with this country, the infamous sari. Here, we handpick vintage one-of-a-kind saris and upcycle these beautiful textiles into bags and scarves. Women in nearby villages combine the fabrics by creating exquisite running hand stitch patterns on the saris in a process called Kantha stitch to give a unique texture and handmade feel to these fabulous products.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>

						<li data-wikidata="Q1216891" geo-label-placement="SW" geo-lat="26.81" geo-lon="75.7">
							<h6>Sanganer</h6>
							<p>Just 10 miles south of Jaipur is the hamlet of Sanganer, a world renowned village known for it's distinctly vibrant style of hand block printing which dates back to the 17th century. Sanganeri block printing received it's own geographical indication tag in 2010, certifying the block printed products from this area as genuinely handmade according to traditional methods.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>

						<li data-wikidata="Q1216891" geo-label-placement="NW" geo-lat="34.07" geo-lon="74.8">
							<h5>Srinagar</h5>
							<p>The Jammu & Kashmir chapter of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra_painting">Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage in Srinagar</a> works toward the promotion of the craft heritage of local Kashmiri communities. Our crewel embroidery products are part of the effort to sustainably develop rural Kashmiri communities by upgrading intricate craft skills. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh" class="wikipedia"></a></p>
