## Website up and running using Jekyll

I have never built a website before, this is the first, and its been a breeze.

Thanks to good friend Saneef, who introduced me to his friend [Jekyll](), I got the site running from scratch in a day mostly with just [HTML5 Boilerplate](), [ZURB Foundation]() for the layout and this [great Jekyll tutorial](https://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/tutorial)

## Code
Is up on [github](), feel free to contribute.
