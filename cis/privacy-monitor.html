        <p>In March 2010, The UIDAI has entered into an <a href="http://uidai.gov.in/UID_PDF/Front_Page_Articles/MOU/MOUsSigned/MoU-MP.pdf ">MoU</a> with
          the government of Madya Pradesh for the implementation of the UID project through
          enrollment agencies. Madhya Pradesh became the <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1409744/report-madhya-pradesh-to-blaze-trail-in-uid-project">first Indian state to award a large scale UID-related project</a> in
          2010. The state government inked a Rs 250 crore contract with a consortium of
          companies headed by the Noida-based HCL Infosystems, part of the HCL group.
          MP has chosen a slightly different path compared to the pilot projects implemented
          in places like Chandigarh, which involved the use of smartcards. Instead of
          handing its citizens electronic storage cards that contain their identities
          and entitlements, the state has decided to use a combination of hi-tech printing
          and the Indian postal service to prevent pilferage of subsidized food grains,
          sugar and fuel.According to the current list, MP has 80 lakh above-the-poverty-line
          families and 68 lakh below-the-line families, qualifying for subsidies of Rs
          125 and Rs 300 per month each respectively. The total subsidy is around Rs 2,500
          crore per year, but is expected to decline considerably after the implementation
          of the scheme.The UID-compliant reconstruction of the PDS database is expected
          to involve around 7,000-10,000 people and take one year to complete.

      <p>In 2011 the Chandigarh police was the first urban police in India to acquire a UAV. In particular, 
        The Chandigarh Police have become the first police force in the country to
        procure an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) &mdash;<a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chandigarh-police-get-uav/article1712117.ece">&#39;Golden Hawk&#39;</a>
        &mdash; for policing. TheGolden Hawk weighs 625 gm. Depending on its success, bigger UAVs will be procured later on for surveillance purposes. The UAV will keep a &quot;

        taking place in the city. This UAV will allegedly help the UT Police in policing, traffic management, securing areas during visits by VVIPs, disaster management, research and development, defence and security. The Golden Hawk runs on battery and is equipped with a powerful small camera which can record the activities on ground zero. The machine has an operational range of 2 km and can take video from an altitude of 80-100 m. The machine flies for about half-an-hour and it returns to its station with the footage. The Chandigarh police is also set to acquire the

        was recently tested in Chatisgarh to evaluate its utility to fight Naxal

        seems to better conform with police uses, since its localized, low-level
