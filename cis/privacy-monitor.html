        <p>In March 2010, The UIDAI has entered into an <a href="http://uidai.gov.in/UID_PDF/Front_Page_Articles/MOU/MOUsSigned/MoU-MP.pdf ">MoU</a> with
          the government of Madya Pradesh for the implementation of the UID project through
          enrollment agencies. Madhya Pradesh became the <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1409744/report-madhya-pradesh-to-blaze-trail-in-uid-project">first Indian state to award a large scale UID-related project</a> in
          2010. The state government inked a Rs 250 crore contract with a consortium of
          companies headed by the Noida-based HCL Infosystems, part of the HCL group.
          MP has chosen a slightly different path compared to the pilot projects implemented
          in places like Chandigarh, which involved the use of smartcards. Instead of
          handing its citizens electronic storage cards that contain their identities
          and entitlements, the state has decided to use a combination of hi-tech printing
          and the Indian postal service to prevent pilferage of subsidized food grains,
          sugar and fuel.According to the current list, MP has 80 lakh above-the-poverty-line
          families and 68 lakh below-the-line families, qualifying for subsidies of Rs
          125 and Rs 300 per month each respectively. The total subsidy is around Rs 2,500
          crore per year, but is expected to decline considerably after the implementation
          of the scheme.The UID-compliant reconstruction of the PDS database is expected
          to involve around 7,000-10,000 people and take one year to complete.

          The efficacy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as an early warning mechanism against
          enemy sneaking in aboard hijacked or rouge vessels was demonstrated during Exercise
          Gemini-2, the second edition of integrated coastal defence drill for Kerala
          and Lakshadweep. In 2003 it was reported that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
          were put on surveillance and reconnaissance missions along the country's coasts.
          The Kerala coast and Lakshadweep and Andaman and the Nicobar islands, are under
          the surveillance of the UAVs. The missions, challenges and startegic implications
