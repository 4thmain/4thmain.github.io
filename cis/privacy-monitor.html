                <p>In the state of Andhra Pradesh police have used CCTV footage in efforts to
                  solve crimes and for law enforcement. CCTVs are also used to monitor traffic
                  and are used by private companies. Companies that source CCTV security systems
                  to districts in Andhra Pradesh include: Mantra, Indosoft Corporation and
                  Spy Action India Home Products. CCTV cameras at Secunderabad railway station
                  reportedly helped the police solve the theft of a handbag forgotten by a
                  passenger.

                  in 2012 that a UAV was used on an experimental basis in Andhra Pradesh and
                  neighbouring Chhattisgarh and the results were positive enough for the drone
                  to be introduced in anti-Maoist operations.

                <p>Andhra Pradesh is considered to be the first state in India to launch the
                  CCTNS project. In January 2012 the Tata Consultancy services (TCS) signed
                  an MoU with the Andhra Pradesh police to implement a crime tracking system
                  across the country. The tender fee for the implementation of the CCTNS is
                  Rs. 25,000 and the Andhra Pradesh Police Department has invited sealed bids
                  from reputed IT Companies / firms for the selection of a System Integrator
                  (SI) for implementing and maintaining the CCTNS project across the state.
                  The CCTNS pilot project launched in the three units --Cyberabad, West Godavari
                  and Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh, the DGP said the remaining districts and
                  units in the state will be completed in second phase by September 2013.
                  Talking to reporters after launching the project, the DGP said it is nationwide
                  project connected to MHA,NCRB, New Delhi and all State capitals and Union
                  Territories of the country and is a significant landmark in making police
                  more accessible transparent and citizen friendly. According to West Godavari
                  district Superintendent of Police M. Ramesh, the CCTNS project came into
                  existence with three initial featuresâ€”Andhra Pradesh Police Messaging System
                  (APPMS), an investigator tool to track the identity of mobile phone and
                  vehicle users and the Andhra Pradesh Police Website. If fully operational,
                  the CCTNS project is expected to extend all sorts of citizen services relating
                  to the policing to the people online, besides helping the police receive
                  an interface with citizens and different government departments such as
                  Prisons, RTA, Passport, Civil Supplies, Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL)
                  and Election Commission and also receive feed from informants.

                  The UID project which aims to remove the problem of wrong identity is intended

                  census 2011 was made. The second phase of the census was conducted in February
                  2011. As per the provisional figures, the total population of the state
                  stood at 13 Lakhs (1.3 Million). As of 2012, the government of Arunachal
                  Pradesh invited proposals for setting up data entry centers, bulk data entry,
                  biometric data collection and printing of local register of usual registers

                  to instill confidence in working journalists. Companies like Senstar Corp
                  and SpyActionIndia have been found to provide CCTV products in the state.

                <p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are being used extensively in Chhattisgarh
                  which is the worst affected by Maoist violence, by the Police and CRPF in
                  their efforts to hunt and track Maoists mainly in the heavily forested regions
                  of state. As per reports UAVâ€™s are used to gather information on location
                  of camps, movement of insurgents and detect mines and IEDs. The Drones which
                  have operated from Hyderabad are being shifted to Bhilai in Chhattisgarh.
                  In April 2013, a UAV was used to record an encounter between the security
                  forces and Maoists. However, UAVâ€™s have not been entirely successful in
                  providing sufficient intelligence inputs due to several operational handicaps.

                <p>In March 2010, The UIDAI has entered into an <a href="http://uidai.gov.in/UID_PDF/Front_Page_Articles/MOU/MOUsSigned/MoU-MP.pdf ">MoU</a> with
                  the government of Madya Pradesh for the implementation of the UID project
                  through enrollment agencies. Madhya Pradesh became the <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1409744/report-madhya-pradesh-to-blaze-trail-in-uid-project">first Indian state to award a large scale UID-related project</a> in
                  2010. The state government inked a Rs 250 crore contract with a consortium
                  of companies headed by the Noida-based HCL Infosystems, part of the HCL
                  group. MP has chosen a slightly different path compared to the pilot projects
                  implemented in places like Chandigarh, which involved the use of smartcards.
                  Instead of handing its citizens electronic storage cards that contain their
                  identities and entitlements, the state has decided to use a combination
                  of hi-tech printing and the Indian postal service to prevent pilferage of
                  subsidized food grains, sugar and fuel.According to the current list, MP
                  has 80 lakh above-the-poverty-line families and 68 lakh below-the-line families,
                  qualifying for subsidies of Rs 125 and Rs 300 per month each respectively.
                  The total subsidy is around Rs 2,500 crore per year, but is expected to
                  decline considerably after the implementation of the scheme.The UID-compliant
                  reconstruction of the PDS database is expected to involve around 7,000-10,000
                  people and take one year to complete.

                <p>UID: A <a href="http://uidai.gov.in/UID_PDF/Front_Page_Articles/MOU/MOUsSigned/MOU_Chandigarh.pdf">MoU</a> was
                  executed between the Unique Identity Authority of India and the Union Territory
                  of Chandigarh in June 2010. In July 2012 the city administration took a
                  lead in recognising UID as a valid proof of identity and address. <a href="http://zeenews.india.com/news/punjab/chandigarh-declares-uid-as-valid-proof-of-identity_785486.html">UID enrolment in Chandigarh has crossed the 60 per cent mark</a> as
                  over 6.5 lakh residents have been enrolled with the UID Authority. UID numbers
                  have been issued to approximately 5.5 lakh people. Other <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/chandigarh-among-best-performing-uts-in-uid-enrolment-in-country-say-officials/1038752/">sources</a> state
                  that around 7.7 lakh people have been enrolled for the UID cards and efforts
                  have been stepped up to take the figure to a 100 per cent. City residents
                  who still haven't got their Unique Identification ( UID) or Aadhaar number,
                  can now go to an enrollment centre in their locality as UT administration
                  has decided to set up <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-06/chandigarh/33648660_1_aadhaar-letter-aadhaar-number-aadhaar-enrolment-centres">additional centres</a> in
                  the city. The sites identified include community centres in sectors 21 and
                  45 (operational up to September 9), community centres at sectors 19, 28
                  and 42 (operational from Sept 10 to Sept 16). In addition, one enrolment
                  centre has also been set up at Punjab University (near post office). These
                  centres are in addition to those already working as Aadhaar Enrolment Centres
                  at Sampark Centres in sectors 10, 15, 23, 40, 47 and Manimajra. Chandigarh
                  DC informed the High Court that the <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Punjab/Chandigarh/Office-order-of-making-UID-mandatory-withdrawn-by-Chandigarh-DC/SP-Article1-1019943.aspx">office order</a> of
                  December 5, 2012, making UID (Aadhar) card mandatory for registration of
                  vehicles and applying for driving licence, has been withdrawn.
