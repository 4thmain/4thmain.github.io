  </span><span>&nbsp;in 2010. The state government inked a Rs 250 crore contract with a consortium of companies headed by the Noida-based HCL Infosystems, part of the HCL group. MP has chosen a slightly different path compared to the pilot projects implemented in places like Chandigarh, which involved the use of smartcards. Instead of handing its citizens electronic storage cards that contain their identities and entitlements, the state has decided to use a combination of hi-tech printing and the Indian postal service to prevent pilferage of subsidized food grains, sugar and fuel.According to the current list, MP has 80 lakh above-the-poverty-line families and 68 lakh below-the-line families, qualifying for subsidies of Rs 125 and Rs 300 per month each respectively. The total subsidy is around Rs 2,500 crore per year, but is expected to decline considerably after the implementation of the scheme.The UID-compliant reconstruction of the PDS database is expected to involve around 7,000-10,000 people and take one year to complete. </span>
